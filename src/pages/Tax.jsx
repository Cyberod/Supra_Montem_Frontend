    "We have partners who are Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Taxation, giving our tax team a unique depth of expertise. We have represented major global clients in landmark tax disputes and regularly advise on the tax implications of significant corporate, financial, and commercial transactions. Our work spans federal taxes (including income, capital gains, customs duties, VAT, and stamp duties), as well as state and local government levies.",

    "We collaborate with non-lawyer tax consultants where necessary, while also handling areas that typically go beyond the scope of accountants â€” such as litigation, constitutional tax questions, drafting agreements with specific tax objectives, and navigating registry-related tax rules. Importantly, our lawyer-client communications enjoy legal privilege, providing an extra layer of protection."
